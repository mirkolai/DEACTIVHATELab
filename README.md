Recognizing Hate with NLP: The Teaching Experience of the#DEACTIVHATELab in Italian High Schools


The possibility of raising awareness about misbehaviour online, such as hate speech, especially in young generations could help society to reduce their impact, and thus, their consequences.
The Computer Science Department of the University of Turin has designed various technologies that support educational projects and activities in this perspective. 
We implemented an annotation platform for Italian tweets employed in a laboratory called #DeactivHate, specifically designed for secondary school students. The laboratory aims at countering hateful phenomena online and making students aware of technologies that they use on a daily basis.
We describe our teaching experience in high schools and the usefulness of the technologies and activities tested.
